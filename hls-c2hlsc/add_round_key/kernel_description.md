## add_round_key

An implementation of the "add round key" step of the AES encryption algorithm. It is responsible for adding the round key to the state in each round of the encryption process. The round key is added to the state by performing an XOR operation between the state and the round key. This kernel is designed to be highly efficient and optimized for hardware implementation.

Top-Level Function: `AddRoundKey`

Inputs:

- `round`: an 8-bit unsigned integer representing the current round number.
- `state`: a 2D array of 4x4 unsigned 8-bit integers, representing the intermediate state of the encryption process.
- `RoundKey`: a 1D array of unsigned 8-bit integers, representing the round key for the current round.

Outputs:

- `state`: the updated 2D array of 4x4 unsigned 8-bit integers, representing the state after adding the round key.

Important Data Structures and Data Types:

- `state_t`: a 2D array of 4x4 unsigned 8-bit integers, representing the intermediate state of the encryption process.
- `uint8_t`: an 8-bit unsigned integer type, used to represent individual bytes of the state and round key.

Sub-Components:

- None. The AddRoundKey kernel is a self-contained function that performs the round key addition operation.
