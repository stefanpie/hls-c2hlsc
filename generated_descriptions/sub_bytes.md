Description:
The SubBytes kernel is a high-level synthesis hardware design that implements the substitution step of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm. It takes a 4x4 state matrix as input and substitutes each byte of the matrix with a corresponding value from a pre-computed S-box lookup table. The S-box is a non-linear substitution table that is used to introduce confusion in the AES algorithm. The kernel iterates over each byte of the input state matrix, performs a table lookup using the S-box, and replaces the original byte with the substituted value.

Top-Level Function: `SubBytes`

Inputs:
- `state`: a 4x4 matrix of uint8_t values, representing the intermediate results during decryption.

Outputs:
- `state`: the modified 4x4 matrix of uint8_t values, with each byte substituted using the S-box lookup table.

Important Data Structures and Data Types:
- `state_t`: a 4x4 matrix of uint8_t values, used to represent the intermediate results during decryption.
- `sbox`: a 256-element lookup table of uint8_t values, used for substitution.

Sub-Components:
- `getSBoxValue`: a function that performs a table lookup using the S-box and returns the substituted value for a given input byte.
